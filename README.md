Functional Data Analysis is an exciting branch of statistics where your data, instead of being random numbers, are random _functions_. In this spirit, there are many functional analogs to classic tests and summary statistics, as well as purely functional ideas. This package aims to eventually implement most of the techniques outlined by Ramsay and Silverman in their groundbreaking text _Functional Data Analysis_, but right now it is a pretty new package, and only has capability for a functional ANOVA. (Hint: contributions are welcome!)

Stay tuned... installation instructions coming soon (I hope).
